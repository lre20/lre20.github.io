# So, you sent a stupid message.


If you've been sent this link, it means you've sent a vulgar/misogynistic message to a fellow internet user, be it on a dating app, social media, or other website/communication tool.


They sent you this since they feel you might want some education.


I'm just a woman, who's received my fair share of misogynistic and graphic messages online. I really hope you read this, and take it into account. When you learn to be kinder and more understanding, you make the world a better place.


Here's a handful of links that you can get to read about feminism, misogyny, and treating women better.


I hope you have a lovely day!
